# A ConfigMap is an API object used to store non-confidential data in key-value pairs. Pods can consume ConfigMaps as environment variables, command-line arguments, or as configuration files in a volume.
## A ConfigMap allows you to decouple environment-specific configuration from your container images, so that your applications are easily portable.
